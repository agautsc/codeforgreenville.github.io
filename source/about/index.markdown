# Who we are
We are a volunteer group of upstate citizens organizing the upstate technology community around open source civic technology development. Inspired by [Code for America](codeforamerica.org) and [brigades](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/) all over the US we seek to: educate the community about power of [Open Data](https://okfn.org/opendata/), build [open source applications](http://codeforamerica.org/apps/) to use open data to solve community issues, and cultivate a culture of entrepreneurship around civic technology.

# Why a 'Brigade'?
It's an nod to Ben Frankin's volunteer fire brigade. They saw a problem with their City's ability to fight fires and created a solution. In the same vein we see issues with our City and believe that we can make a difference by actively building tools for our local community.


# What does the Brigade do?
1. We work with local upstate municipal governments and civic groups to identify opportunities to open civic data and use it in new ways.
2. We host Hackathons to introduce challenges to the tech community and develop rapid prototype applications to solve community issues .
3. We foster prototype development with weekly development nights so they become full blown applications.
4. We contribute to and redeploy applications from other Brigades around the US.

# What is Open Data?
Data is the stuff most people and organizations have tucked away in spreadsheets and databases. Open Data is when that information made available to the public in such a way that it can be spidered or indexed, its available in open and machine-readable formats, and a legal framework that allows it to be re-purposed. Most municipalities already disclose information to the public in the forms of reports, budgets, meeting minutes, schedules and the like as a result of long standing efforts to encourage government transparency. Open Data is the next step on the path of Government Transparency.

# How does Open Data solve community issues?
Opening up civic data permits application developers to use that information to solve problems as fast as they can access the data. Rather than waiting on strained municipal budges and staff to get around to it years and lots of taxpayer dollars later - application developers can put together game changing applications in weeks or months based off open data. These community built solutions can then be extended to other municipalities and drive new business opportunities and civic start ups.

## Here are some examples:

[Development FastPass](http://lv-fastpass.herokuapp.com/) combines parcel data, land use, zoning, building occupancy, and business incentives to help business owners research the best options to locate their businesses.

[Honolulu Answers](http://answers.honolulu.gov/) is a new approach to make it easier for people to navigate city information and services quickly. It's a citizen-focused website that is question-driven, with clean, easy-to-navigate design.

[Ohana Web Search](http://ohanapi.org/) - helps connect citizens to government and nonprofit social services.

# Who can join?
Anyone who wants to contribute, sees a need, or wants to build something. You don't have to do this for a living to be a vital and contributing member of the Brigade.

  * Plan and Organize Hackathons & Hack Nights
