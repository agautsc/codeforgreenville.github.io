# Application Details

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/codeforamerica/fast_pass)  

Live Sites:  

   * [Las Vegas Fast Pass](http://lv-fastpass.herokuapp.com/)

[Concept and Use Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lTPz0Qp8sA)  

# What is it?
Development FastPass combines parcel data, land use, zoning, building occupancy, and business incentives to help business owners research the best options to locate their businesses within Las Vegas.

# Evaluation for Greenville
## 1. **Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?**  

   This app helps make sense of a variety of local regulations regarding buisness location in a city. The app could be very useful in encouraging buisness growth in Greenville by making it simpler to find suitable locations for new businesses.

## 2. **Will the citizens of greenville use this application?**  
   if they are interested in starting a business its likely they will use it.

## 3. **Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?**  
   no. it will likely have a variety of challenges or bugs to iron out.

## 4. **What are the technical depedencies?**  
   * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) & [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/)
   * The App Repository lacks robust redeployment documentation. We will likely have a good bit of figuring out to do.  
## 5. **What are the data dependencies?**  
   This application will require access to experts on city development staff to help formalize rules & regulations.
   1. Zoning Rules need to be formalized
   2. Parcel Data required (location and attributes)
   3. City & Neighborhood geographic definitions
   4. Business Licensing Codes (needs to be mapped to North American Industry Classification System - NAICS)

## 6. **How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?**  

   unknown. Likely it will not cost much, its not a big application.

## 7. **How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?**  
   Since it hasn't been redeployed a comprehensive redeployment guide would be a major contribution to the community.
