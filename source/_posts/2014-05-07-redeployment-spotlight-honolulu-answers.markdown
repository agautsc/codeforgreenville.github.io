# What is it?
Honolulu Answers is a citizen-focused website that is question-driven, with clean, easy-to-navigate design. You can ask a question or type in keywords using plain language. You'll receive simple, friendly, concise, easy-to-understand responses, as though they're coming from a neighbor.

# Evaluation for Greenville
1. **Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?**  possibly, if  citizens are frustrated with the [current site](http://greenvillesc.gov/) it might be helpful.  
2. **Will the citizens of greenville use this application?**  open for discussion  
3. Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?  **Yes** Open Oakland Redeployed it in 2013.
4. **What are the technical depedencies?**
  Local Deployment Support: OSX and Linux
  Cloud Deployment Support: Heroku
  Ruby Version Supported: 1.9.3
  Rails Version: 3.2
  PostgreSQL Server Required
  3rd Party Services:
  * Searchify (or another IndexTank API provider or your own instance)
  * BigHugeThesaurus
  * Amazon S3 (Required for uploading avatars of user-submitted content (author_pic))
  * KISSmetrics (if you wish to use their analytics service)

5. **What are the data dependencies?** None. This site runs on data generated by citizens (both questions and answers) at a ["write-a-thon"](http://codeforamerica.github.io/honolulu-writeathon/) event that is then reviewed by city staff for accuracy. Answers will link back to existing content on the city's normal site.
6. **How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?**
  a good question. It looks like the city of honolulu is picking up the tab for the service accounts for their app. I'll check with the CfA folks and see if we can get an estimate from Honolulu or Oakland.
7. **How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?** There are a couple of hack requests open we could contribute to:
  1.  [Answers Community Event Kit](https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-community-kit.md) The write-a-thon community kit should be a web-based, step-by-step guide to running a write-a-thon. [something more robust than this presumably](http://neighborhow.org/guides/host-a-writeathon-in-your-city).
  2. [Answers Analytics Features](https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-visitor-display.md) Add a completely-public baked-in analytics view, so any visitor can see what's being looked at.
  3. [Answers SEO Optimization](https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-seo-optimization.md)
