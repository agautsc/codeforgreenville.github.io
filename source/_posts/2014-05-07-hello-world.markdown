# Itâ€™s ALIVE!

Welcome to the Code for Greenville Brigade Blog! It is very much a work in progress but you should see regular changes over the next few weeks. For the curious the site repository is  available [here](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/codeforgreenville.github.io).
GitHub, Ruby, Jekyll, Markup, and Bootstrap are all very new to me so its been a fun challenge to get this site stood up.

# Join the Meetup Group
If you have not signed up for the [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Greenville-Brigade/) please hop over there and join up if you are so inclined. Our first meeting is on **May 27th** see the meetup for more details.

# Get the word out
If your here you probably know a few folks in the Greenville Community who might be interested. Lend us a hand in spreading the word about the Code for Greenville Brigade and make sure those folks know about us!

# Shout outs
A big thank you to [GitHub](http://github.com) for hosting, [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for the framework, and [octostrap3](https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3) for the Bootstrap3.1 Octopress theme.
