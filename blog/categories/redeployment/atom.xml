<h1>Application Details</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/fast_pass">GitHub Repository</a></p>

<p>Live Sites:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://lv-fastpass.herokuapp.com/">Las Vegas Fast Pass</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>What is it?</h1>

<p>Development FastPass combines parcel data, land use, zoning, building occupancy, and business incentives to help business owners research the best options to locate their businesses within Las Vegas.</p>

<h1>Evaluation for Greenville</h1>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</strong></p>

<p>This app helps make sense of a variety of local regulations regarding buisness location in a city. The app could be very useful in encouraging buisness growth in Greenville by making it simpler to find suitable locations for new businesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</strong><br/>
if they are interested in starting a business its likely they will use it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</strong><br/>
no. it will likely have a variety of challenges or bugs to iron out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are the technical depedencies?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> &amp; <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a></li>
<li>The App Repository lacks robust redeployment documentation. We will likely have a good bit of figuring out to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What are the data dependencies?</strong><br/>
This application will require access to experts on city development staff to help formalize rules &amp; regulations.</p>

<ol>
<li>Zoning Rules need to be formalized</li>
<li>Parcel Data required (location and attributes)</li>
<li>City &amp; Neighborhood geographic definitions</li>
<li>Business Licensing Codes (needs to be mapped to North American Industry Classification System &ndash; NAICS)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</strong></p>

<p>unknown. Likely it will not cost much, its not a big application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</strong><br/>
Since it hasn&rsquo;t been redeployed a comprehensive redeployment guide would be a major contribution to the community.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Application Details</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/honolulu_answers">GitHub Repository</a></p>

<p>Live Sites:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://answers.honolulu.gov/">Honolulu Answers</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://answers.oaklandnet.com/">Oakland Answers</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>What is it?</h1>

<p>Honolulu Answers is a citizen-focused website that is question-driven, with clean, easy-to-navigate design. You can ask a question or type in keywords using plain language. You&rsquo;ll receive simple, friendly, concise, easy-to-understand responses, as though they&rsquo;re coming from a neighbor.</p>

<h1>Evaluation for Greenville</h1>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</strong><br/>
possibly, if  citizens are frustrated with the <a href="http://greenvillesc.gov/">current site</a> it might be helpful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</strong><br/>
open for discussion</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</strong><br/>
Yes. Open Oakland Redeployed it in 2013.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are the technical depedencies?</strong><br/>
<em>Local Deployment Support:</em> OSX and Linux<br/>
<em>Cloud Deployment Support:</em> Heroku<br/>
<em>Ruby Version Supported:</em> 1.9.3<br/>
<em>Rails Version:</em> 3.2<br/>
<em>PostgreSQL Server Required</em><br/>
<em>3rd Party Services:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Searchify (or another IndexTank API provider or your own instance)</li>
<li>BigHugeThesaurus</li>
<li>Amazon S3 (Required for uploading avatars of user-submitted content   (author_pic))</li>
<li>KISSmetrics (if you wish to use their analytics service)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What are the data dependencies?</strong><br/>
None. This site runs on data generated by citizens (both questions and answers) at a <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.io/honolulu-writeathon/">&ldquo;write-a-thon&rdquo;</a> event that is then reviewed by city staff for accuracy. Answers will link back to existing content on the city&rsquo;s normal site.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</strong></p>

<p>a good question. It looks like the city of honolulu is picking up the tab for the service accounts for their app. I&rsquo;ll check with the CfA folks and see if we can get an estimate from Honolulu or Oakland.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</strong><br/>
There are a couple of hack requests open we could contribute to:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-community-kit.md">Answers Community Event Kit</a> The write-a-thon community kit should be a web-based, step-by-step guide to running a write-a-thon. <a href="http://neighborhow.org/guides/host-a-writeathon-in-your-city">something more robust than this presumably</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-visitor-display.md">Answers Analytics Features</a> Add a completely-public baked-in analytics view, so any visitor can see what&rsquo;s being looked at.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-seo-optimization.md">Answers SEO Optimization</a></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>About Redeployment &amp; The Spotlight Series</h1>

<p>One of the primary goals of the Code for Greenville Brigade is to contribute to the spread of Open Civic Tech. One big way to contribute to the community at large and knock out a quick win as a Brigade is to <strong>Redeploy</strong> other apps that were developed in other cities by other brigades. This allows us to stand on the shoulders of our peers in other cities and gives us an opportunity to improve their work and pay it forward. In the weeks to come we are going to post a series of posts highlighting applications the Code for Greenville Brigade might want to consider redeploying.</p>

<h1>What are we looking for?</h1>

<p>Some key factors we should consider before we redeploy an application:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</li>
<li>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</li>
<li>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</li>
<li>What are the technical depedencies?</li>
<li>What are the data dependencies?</li>
<li>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</li>
<li>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</li>
</ol>


<h1>How you can help</h1>

<ol>
<li>Take a look at each application. Poke around and see what you think about it.</li>
<li>Then ask yourself &ldquo;Would this app be helpful to me? and "Would I use this App?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then go ask 2 other greenville citizens the same question. try to pick folks with a different background. see what kind of answers you get.</li>
<li>Now think about Greenville &ndash; what should we consider if we were to deploy this app? Is there something about our town culture or our environment we need to account for or represent?</li>
<li>If your feeling adventurous dive into the apps github site and dive into the code and see what you think.</li>
</ol>


<p>Finally Bring your thoughts back to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Greenville-Brigade/messages/archive/">meetup discussion</a> or the next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Greenville-Brigade/">meetup</a> and help up decide what apps Code for Greenville will be deploying.</p>
