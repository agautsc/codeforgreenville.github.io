<h1>Application Details</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/honolulu_answers">GitHub Repository</a></p>

<p>Live Sites:
  <a href="http://answers.honolulu.gov/">Honolulu Answers</a><br/>
  <a href="http://answers.oaklandnet.com/">Oakland Answers</a></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43632898#">Concept and Use Video</a></p>

<h1>What is it?</h1>

<p>Honolulu Answers is a citizen-focused website that is question-driven, with clean, easy-to-navigate design. You can ask a question or type in keywords using plain language. You&rsquo;ll receive simple, friendly, concise, easy-to-understand responses, as though they&rsquo;re coming from a neighbor.</p>

<h1>Evaluation for Greenville</h1>

<ol>
<li><strong>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</strong>  possibly, if  citizens are frustrated with the <a href="http://greenvillesc.gov/">current site</a> it might be helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</strong>  open for discussion</li>
<li>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?  <strong>Yes</strong> Open Oakland Redeployed it in 2013.</li>
<li><strong>What are the technical depedencies?</strong>
Local Deployment Support: OSX and Linux
Cloud Deployment Support: Heroku
Ruby Version Supported: 1.9.3
Rails Version: 3.2
PostgreSQL Server Required
3rd Party Services:</li>
<li>Searchify (or another IndexTank API provider or your own instance)</li>
<li>BigHugeThesaurus</li>
<li>Amazon S3 (Required for uploading avatars of user-submitted content (author_pic))</li>
<li><p>KISSmetrics (if you wish to use their analytics service)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are the data dependencies?</strong> None. This site runs on data generated by citizens (both questions and answers) at a <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.io/honolulu-writeathon/">&ldquo;write-a-thon&rdquo;</a> event that is then reviewed by city staff for accuracy. Answers will link back to existing content on the city&rsquo;s normal site.</p></li>
<li><strong>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</strong>
a good question. It looks like the city of honolulu is picking up the tab for the service accounts for their app. I&rsquo;ll check with the CfA folks and see if we can get an estimate from Honolulu or Oakland.</li>
<li><strong>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</strong> There are a couple of hack requests open we could contribute to:</li>
<li>  <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-community-kit.md">Answers Community Event Kit</a> The write-a-thon community kit should be a web-based, step-by-step guide to running a write-a-thon. <a href="http://neighborhow.org/guides/host-a-writeathon-in-your-city">something more robust than this presumably</a>.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-visitor-display.md">Answers Analytics Features</a> Add a completely-public baked-in analytics view, so any visitor can see what&rsquo;s being looked at.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-seo-optimization.md">Answers SEO Optimization</a></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>About Redeployment &amp; The Spotlight Series</h1>

<p>One of the primary goals of the Code for Greenville Brigade is to contribute to the spread of Open Civic Tech. One big way to contribute to the community at large and knock out a quick win as a Brigade is to <strong>Redeploy</strong> other apps that were developed in other cities by other brigades. This allows us to stand on the shoulders of our peers in other cities and gives us an opportunity to improve their work and pay it forward. In the weeks to come we are going to post a series of posts highlighting applications the Code for Greenville Brigade might want to consider redeploying.</p>

<h1>What are we looking for?</h1>

<p>Some key factors we should consider before we redeploy an application:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</li>
<li>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</li>
<li>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</li>
<li>What are the technical depedencies?</li>
<li>What are the data dependencies?</li>
<li>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</li>
<li>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</li>
</ol>


<h1>How you can help</h1>

<ol>
<li>Take a look at each application. Poke around and see what you think about it.</li>
<li>Then ask yourself &ldquo;Would this app be helpful to me? and "Would I use this App?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then go ask 2 other greenville citizens the same question. try to pick folks with a different background. see what kind of answers you get.</li>
<li>Now think about Greenville &ndash; what should we consider if we were to deploy this app? Is there something about our town culture or our environment we need to account for or represent?</li>
<li>If your feeling adventurous dive into the apps github site and dive into the code and see what you think.</li>
</ol>


<p>Finally Bring your thoughts back to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Greenville-Brigade/messages/archive/">meetup discussion</a> or the next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Greenville-Brigade/">meetup</a> and help up decide what apps Code for Greenville will be deploying.</p>
